Useful scripts
==============

Here lies some useful and quirky scripts that I often use on a daily basis, to
make my life easier. YMMV.

- proj: Project and repository management
- title.sh: Terminal title manipulation
- keepass-keyring: Start Keepass with a password stored in a system keyring
- lock.sh: Cool lock screen
