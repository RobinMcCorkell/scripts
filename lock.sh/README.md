lock.sh
=======

Cool lock screen image, pixellating a screenshot of your current desktop,
desaturating it, then overlaying a lock icon.

Installation
------------

Copy `lock.sh` to somewhere you can run it.

You need `scrot` and `imagemagick`. This tool uses `i3lock` to do the actual
locking, but any locker that takes an image will work (YMMV).

Also provide a `lock-icon.png`. I am not able to redistribute the lock icon
I am using.

Run `lock.sh` to lock your screen.
